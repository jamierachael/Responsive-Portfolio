<!-- This is a paragraph-->
        <p>I am a product specialist and administrative professional with 8+ years of experience in various sectors.</p>
        <p>Recognized for demonstrating independent discipline, flexibility, and a customer-oriented attitude, I have a verifiable history of contributing directly to company growth and expansion throughout my career. Professional focal points include sales, scheduling, data entry, web formatting, proofreading/editing, social media marketing, content management, cross-functional team leadership, complex problem-solving, and client relationship management.</p>
        <p>I was previously a Remote eCommerce Product Specialist for CopperSmith. Under my leadership, I promoted and sold products to existing and prospective customers. I also oversaw administrative functions and special projects using Magento, Zendesk Talk, and Google apps. In addition, I collaborated with senior staff and departmental managers to ensure that the companyâ€™s product support structure is driving the business forward with minimal expenditures.        </p>
        <p>Prior to this I established a record of success with Astrologer: Coach Sonja Francis. As an adept remote administrative/social media assistant, I perform a variety of tasks to support smooth operations, including scheduling appointments; outlining, formatting, and editing blog posts; and managing customer responses. </p>
        <p>I am interested in learning about new opportunities and can be reached through this profile or by email: <a href="mailto:jamie.rachael@gmail.com" target="_blank">jamie.rachael@gmail.com</a></p>
